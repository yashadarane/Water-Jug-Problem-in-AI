# Water-Jug-Problem-in-AI

The water jug problem is the basic way to introduce yourself into search algorithms. It has numerous real world application. 
There are two ways to solve it Depth-First-Search and Breadth-First-Search.

## Problem Description
There exists two jugs of x L and y L, and an aim is given to the user to get specific quantity z L of water in the jug. The jugs cannot be partially filled, there are no measuring devices present, the jugs can be filled from the tap many times and the water from the jugs can be thrown away. 

## Depth First Search (DFS)
In DFS the algorithm checks each path as deeply as possible before backtracking. It usually does not provide the most optimal solution.
